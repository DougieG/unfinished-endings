## What You DON'T Need

❌ **Raspberry Pi** - Arduino is better for this
❌ **Audio interface** - Using USB phone adapters instead
❌ **Soldering iron** - Breadboard is fine for prototype
❌ **External WiFi module** - Nano 33 IoT has it built-in
❌ **Power supply** - USB from computer is fine

## Alternatives if Out of Stock

**If Arduino Nano 33 IoT unavailable:**
- Arduino Uno WiFi Rev2 ($45)
- Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 ($33)
- ESP32 Dev Board ($10) - cheaper but needs more setup

**If RJ11 cables unavailable:**
- Cut old phone cables (free!)
- Just need the green (hook) and yellow (ground) wires
- Use any wire if you strip old cables

## Already Have Arduino?

Check if it has WiFi:
- ✅ Nano 33 IoT - YES
- ✅ Uno WiFi Rev2 - YES
- ✅ MKR WiFi 1010 - YES
- ❌ Uno R3 - NO (need WiFi shield)
- ❌ Nano (original) - NO (need WiFi shield)

If no WiFi, add:
- ESP8266 WiFi Shield (~$10)
- https://www.amazon.com/s?k=esp8266+shield
